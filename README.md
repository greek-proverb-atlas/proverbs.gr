# A computational study of Greek proverbs

## The dataset
* Proverbs collected from the Hellenic Folklore Research Centre (http://www.kentrolaografias.gr). 
* The data are under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licence (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.el). 
* Only the text, the collector, and the place the proverb was collected from are used.
* We share [here](https://ipavlopoulos.github.io/paremia/data/) a subset of 11,500 proverbs, balanced across locations, used in our experiments. 

## The findings
* We show that proverbs are shared not only temporally (from gen to gen) but also spatially, from location to location.
* We share [a map of duplicates](https://nbviewer.org/github/ipavlopoulos/paremia/blob/main/misc/duplicates.html) we compiled. 
* We show [the spatial distribution](https://nbviewer.org/github/ipavlopoulos/paremia/blob/main/misc/frequent_places.html) of proverbs.
* We publish [a map with clickable pins](https://nbviewer.org/github/ipavlopoulos/paremia/blob/main/misc/frequent_ngrams.html), showing terms frequent in one location but not in the rest.
* Finally, using linguistic distance as a means, we compute the shortest path per proverb, revealing possible spatial routes.
